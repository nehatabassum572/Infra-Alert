# InfraAlert

InfraAlert is a civic-tech web application that enables citizens to report, track, and resolve local infrastructure issues such as potholes, water leaks, and streetlight failures.

## Why InfraAlert?
City infrastructure issues often go unreported or unresolved due to lack of transparency.  
InfraAlert bridges the gap between citizens and local authorities by providing a simple, transparent reporting system.
